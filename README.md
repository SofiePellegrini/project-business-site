# Business Site

Week 3 project at the Technigo bootcamp - to make a business site. It should contain a header with a video/image, a form and an accordion. 

## The problem

It took me some time to get the accordion right and to acctually try to understand it. If I would have had more time I would probably have worked more on the styling but with the time I had I'm pleased with the result.
